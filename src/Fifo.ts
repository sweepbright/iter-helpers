     * Push an item to the queue.

     * This method returns `true` if the queue is drained, i.e. the queue's
     * length is less than the highWatermark (if any).
     *
     * This method always pushes an item to the queue, even if the queue is above
     * the highWatermark. The control over this behavior is up to the user.
     *
     * It is recommended to use the `waitDrain` method to wait for the queue to
     * be drained.
     *
     * If a user does not wait for the queue to be drained, the `push` method
     * will push the item even if the queue is above the highWatermark until the
     * process memory is overflowed.
     *
     * To drain a queue, the fifo should be iterated over.
     *
     * If the queue is ended, the `push` method will return `false` and the item
     * will not be pushed.
     *
     * @example
     * const queue = new Fifo<string>();
     * await queue.waitDrain();
     * queue.push("a");
     * await queue.waitDrain();
     * queue.push("b");
     * // etc
     *
     * @param item
     * @returns `true` if the queue is drained, `false` otherwise
